## Vision

Our vision is to complete the **mobile version of BrandGenie Pro** — a powerful, all-in-one workspace for marketing teams and creative professionals.  
With time constraints in mind, we are focused on delivering a version that captures the **core functionality** of the web app, while being optimized for use on mobile devices via Expo Go.

## What is BrandGenie?

BrandGenie Pro is a productivity suite built for marketing teams, freelancers, and project managers. It unifies various tools into a single platform, removing the need to jump between apps like CapCut, Notion, Trello, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Slack.

The mobile version brings these experiences to your phone in a seamless and focused UI, allowing work to continue wherever you are.

## Key Features (Mobile)

- 🎬 **CapCut-style Video Editor**: Upload, cut, trim, adjust, and annotate videos using a clean touch interface.
- 📁 **Drive Workspace**: Upload, view, and organize team files visually, like Google Drive.
- 📅 **Calendar Tool**: Plan campaigns with a Google Calendar–style interface.
- 🧠 **AI Copilot**: Smart task suggestions, idea generation, and content help.
- 📝 **Notion-style Docs**: Create and edit documents collaboratively.
- 📊 **Kanban Boards**: Drag-and-drop project boards for visual progress tracking.
- 📡 **Teams and Chat**: Real-time team messaging and instant video calls.
- 🛍 **Tool Store**: Browse and activate productivity tools from an integrated store.
- 🧑‍💼 **Role-Based Access**: Managers invite team members with controlled access to projects, files, and tools — even with time-bound contracts.

## Who Is It For?

- **Marketing Managers** coordinating content, assets, and schedules.
- **Freelancers** collaborating on brand campaigns and deliverables.
- **Creative Teams** needing one place to handle all their digital tools.

## Development Status

The mobile app is in active development. We aim to replicate all key flows from the web version while designing a mobile-first experience. The landing pages and navigation are ready; next is full tool migration and user interaction polish.
